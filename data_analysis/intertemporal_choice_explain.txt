you have to compute the LL value from the columns val_basic times val_prc
val_basic is the SS. in loopID is the participantnumber and context is 0 for caf√© or 1 for gambling environment. 
	So you should filter the data for one context first. In total every participant has 170 trials in each context
in the Version column is coded which taskversion was used, 
	because each task version uses different delays and LL values.
For the results, you should observe that overall they discount more in context 1 than in context 0.
The cool thing is, for this data we have also the data from around 25 questionaires. Really alot, 
	so we could see which questionaires hold valuable information.
response is the choice with 0 = SS chosen and 1 = LL chosen.
